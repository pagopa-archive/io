## Description
TBD
## Architectural overview
`IO` is a platform composed by an ecosystem of network applications.

The designated _touch point_ for Citizens is **App IO**, a mobile application for iOS and Android smartphones, through which they have access to all services offered onto `IO` platform by Public Organizations. Citizens are idetified by third-party _Identity Provider_ such as [SPID providers](https://www.spid.gov.it/) and [CIE] (https://www.ipzs.it/ext/carta_identita_elettronica_prodotti.html) service (Carta d'identitÃ  elettronica) powered by [Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato](https://www.ipzs.it).

Organizations can integrate their IT systems by using both web portals and exposed API.<br/>If you are an Organization and you are willing to know how to integrate with `IO`, please refer to [our website](https://io.italia.it/).

![architecture overview](assets/architecture-overview.png)

`IO` platform has been designed with these principles in mind:
* _micreservices architecture_: the system is composed by several independent network applications that collaborate to business workflows;
* _everything as code_: we try to code as much as we can, including the infratructure as well as code-review rules and code best practices;
* _open by design_: source code is open and public as well as technical discussions arising from pull requests.

To know more about how such principles are implemented, please refer to application-specific repositories mentioned below.
